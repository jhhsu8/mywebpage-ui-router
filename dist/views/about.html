        My name is Joanne Hsu. I am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and currently living in Seattle. I received my Bachelor's in Plant Biology from UC Davis in 2001 and my Master's in Biotechnology from UC Irvine in 2004 and my PhD in Microbiology
        from UC Berkeley in 2012. At UC Berkeley, I studied the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression implicated in human diseases HIV/AIDS and cancer. I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where I am identifying
        molecular targets of a compound that has been shown to protect against drug-induced hearing loss in animals. Identification of these targets will help us gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of hearing loss. In summer 2015,
        I began to explore computer programming and found it very interesting because it requires creativity and logical thinking. Since then, I have been taking online computer science and web development courses at Coursera and edX, including ones from
        Harvard University, Rice University, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Currently, I am looking for a volunteer opportunity to gain real-life experience in programming and web development or in an IT-related field.
