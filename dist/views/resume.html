      <h3><u><b>Objective</b></u></h3>
      <div>
        <p>I am seeking a volunteer opportunity as a web developer or IT-related work.</p>
        <h3><u><b>Background</b></u></h3>
        <div>
          <p>I would like to volunteer to gain real-life experience in programming and web development. One of my interests is creating relevant and user-friendly websites and web applications. Since summer 2015, I have been learning
            about web development and how to program in Javascript, AngularJS, jQuery, HTML/CSS, C, PHP, SQL, and Python. I can quickly learn and master new technologies and languages and work in both team and independent settings. Here is my first webpage,
            created with Bootstrap and AngularJS:
